StarCraft II AI playing Zerg Macro

Swarmy Zerg Bot going for mostly Roaches. Does a nasty 8 Roach Rush some of the time.

Has solid macro but is pretty brainless overall. Still striving to live up to its name. The micro is somewhat inspired by The Art of War, using four tactics: flee, retreat, fight or pursue.
