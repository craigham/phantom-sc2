StarCraft II AI playing Zerg Macro

A swarmy Zerg Bot taught by the Chinese general himself.

The idea is to make the bot operate on principles that are as abstract as possible. This should make it more resilient to new situations than a more scripted bot, but it also means it doesn't really have situation-specific answers and often time it acts downright stupid.

As of now, it has solid mechanics but dies to most attacks. Ironically, the macro is pretty scripted macro greed into Roach/Hydra into Broodlords. The micro is inspired by The Art of War, using four tactics (flee, retreat, fight and attack) depending on the situation.
